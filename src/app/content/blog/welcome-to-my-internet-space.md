**tldr:** Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm super excited about sharing neat learnings from my journey of software development and design.

# Why I Built This Website

The last personal website I did was a simple project using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was more of a learning exercise, and I helped me get down to the very core of how websites are built. I learned many useful things from that process, which became ground for further future actions.

In the process, I've picked up a few other languages and frameworks. Now, feeling experienced, I thought it best to revisit the necessity of a nicely done portfolio site that speaks for itself—who I am and what I do. This is not only a portfolio site but a space where I can express my thoughts, ideas, and projects out to the world.

# The Inspiration Behind My Design

Before desiging the site, I knew I wanted to add a blog section to be able to share quick thoughts about software development, UI/UX, or any other topic that interests me. As a means of getting inspiration on design, I visited a lot of websites, one of which is [Prettyfolio](https://prettyfolio.com/), that I found through Ansub on X.

I'm a huge believer in clean, minimalistic design that doesn't sacrifice on feel. Much of my design sensibility is borrowed from Apple's design language: clean, simple, and constant UI/UX. To ensure that I wasn't delivering a runaway Frankenstein's monster of different UI elements, I designed this site entirely in Figma before writing a single line of code.

# The Technology Behind the Site

This brings me to the tech stack I used in building this site. I went with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS** and **TypeScript**. Just by putting these technologies together, it gives me a consistent design language that will let me hit an aesthetically-pleasing layout responsive to my minimalistic tastes as well as maintain a type-safe codebase.

I used **remark** and **react-markdown** for the blog feature. This provides a lot of benefits when working with static Markdown files. Among them are:

- **Simplicity**: Markdown is really very easy to write and read. It is just perfect for the creation of content without all the hassle of HTML.
- **Separation of Content and Presentation**: By using Markdown, I am able to work on writing the content totally independent of the styles, enhancing its maintainability.
  - **Performance**: It means it serves raw Markdown files, so they are lightning fast, and your site will enjoy faster loads.
  - **Flexibility**: Markdown provides for easy formatting and gets converted to HTML easily, so it can be flexible for numerous uses.

# Conclusion

I hope you will have as much fun exploring my site as I did making it. This space is about my journey as a developer and designer, so I look forward to sharing my thoughts with you.
